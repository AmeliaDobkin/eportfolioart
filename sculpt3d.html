	<h3>Bard Bunny</h3>
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_meshmixer.jpg" alt="bardbun">
	<h4>Medium: Meshmixer</h4>
<p>This was an exercise in using Meshmixer. I used the default rabbit model to make it.  I put a hat, amulet, and horn on it to turn it into a cute little bard.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Boat Ride</h3>
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_meshmixsketch.jpg" alt="boat ride">
	<h4>Medium: Meshmixer, Sketchfab</h4>
<p>This depicts a cloaked figure holding a spherical seed riding an ingot boat with the bard bunny on a voyage.  This was initially going to be a more ambitious project, but it was later found that one of the models I downloaded to use here was corrupted, rendering the files it was used in unreadable.  This was all I has time to do after that.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Wire Gromit</h3>
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_sculpt1.jpg" alt="wgromit">
	<h4>Medium: Annealed Steel Wire</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 16” x 15” x 8.5”</h4>
<p>The assignment for this was to make a gestural sculpture of a functional object.  I chose my plush of Gromit, one of the eponymous characters in the British stop motion series Wallace and Gromit.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Imaginary Play (play clock)</h3>
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_sculpt2a.jpg" alt="playclock1">
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_sculpt2b.jpg" alt="playclock2">
	<h4>Medium: Laser Cutter, Cloth, Electronics, Polymer Clay, Acrylic Paint</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 11.75” x 9.25” x 6.5”</h4>
<p>This was for an assignment where we had to illustrate the concept of “play” in some way through sculpture.  I chose to depict two children playing pretend on a lawn.  The real world slowly fades away as their fantasy takes over.   Dramatic lighting would be visible when the statue is in the dark. The imagery is somewhat inspired by the 1979 film <i>The Castle of Caigliostro</i>. The gears on the sculpture were originally supposed to move when the "crank" on one of the gears was turned.  However, it did not turn out as planned.</p>
