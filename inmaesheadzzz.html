  		Amelia Dobkin | <i>In Mae's Head</i> | p5, Photoshop, Musescore |<br> Credits: Song-"Space Dragon" by Alec Holowka, arr. by Amelia Dobkin.<br>Mae Borowski and related imagery originally from <i>Night in the Woods</i> developed by Infinite Fall
  		<br>
  		<p>This depicts Mae Borowski, the main character in the video game Night in the Woods, sleeping, with my Musescore rendition of “Space Dragon,” also from Night in the Woods, playing softly in the background.  When the mouse is clicked and dragged across the screen, the music gets louder and another image of Mae playing her bass in space with a dragon while breaking into pieces.  This piece alludes to Mae’s mental health struggles that she deals with throughout the game.</p>
