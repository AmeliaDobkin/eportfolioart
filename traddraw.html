<h3>Meditational drawing</h3>

<h4>Medium: Charcoal, Pencil, Ink Pen</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 26” x 40”</h4>
<p>This was my final assignment from Drawing 1.  The choice of what to draw was left entirely up to students.  I chose to illustrate an action scene in which a hooded figure and a woman are in a sword duel on a skyscraper roof and the hooded figure is nearly pushing the woman off the edge of the building.  I wanted to do this because I generally like the action genre in several mediums and wanted to capture something of what makes action exciting in one frame.</p>

<h3>Rooftop Duel</h3>

<h4>Medium: Ballpoint Pen</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 18” x 24”</h4>
<p>This was for an assignment where we had to make an automatic drawing, which is usually made either when one is tired or has just finished meditating.  I did the former when making this drawing by waking up at 1 AM to make it.</p>
