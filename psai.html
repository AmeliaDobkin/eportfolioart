	<h3>Space Cat</h3>
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_photoshop1.jpg" alt="space cat">
	<h4>Medium: Photoshop</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 1200px x 754px</h4>
<p>This was an experimental image done to practice working with layers in Photoshop.  It was somewhat inspired by the song “Space Dragon” by Alec Holowka, which was stuck in my head the day I made this.  
</p>

	<h3>Butterfly</h3>
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_illustrator.jpg" alt="butterfly">
		<h4>Medium: Illustrator</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 802px x 821px</h4>
<p>This was an exercise using various tools in Illustrator on a photograph of a butterfly.

</p>

	<h3>Untitled</h3>
	<img src="amelia_dobkin_ps2.jpg" alt="swan">
		<h4>Medium: Photoshop</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 600px x 387px</h4>
<p>This was another project using similar techniques to that of Space Cat.  
</p>
	<br>
  <h3>Echos</h3>
  <img src="amelia_dobkin_photoshopaud.jpg" alt="echos">
	<h4>Medium: Photoshop, Audacity</h4>
<h4>Dimensions: 1200 x 647 pixels (original dimensions)</h4>
<p>This was an assignment meant to explore a given topic in some way using Glitch Art.  My topic was Hyperreality.  I wanted to capture the unnerving feeling Hyperrealistic art can sometimes elicit, which I attempted through repeating the image of eyes throughout the piece.</p>
