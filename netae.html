<img src="amelia_dobkin_html.png" alt="juna">
<h4>Medium: HTML, Photoshop</h4>
<p>This HTML page is a fictional diary of a girl named Juna the fictional character Gina has found in her grandmother’s things and has sent to the reader, along with sketches made by Juna (which were made by me in Photoshop) to see if you could help her fill in some blanks in Juna’s story, as well as figuring out who she is.
