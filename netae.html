<h3>Juna's Diary</h3>
<img src="amelia_dobkin_html.png" alt="juna">
<h4>Medium: HTML, Photoshop</h4>
<p>This HTML page is a fictional diary of a girl named Juna the fictional character Gina has found in her grandmother’s things and has sent to the reader, along with sketches made by Juna (which were made by me in Photoshop) to see if you could help her fill in some blanks in Juna’s story, as well as figuring out who she is.

<h3>Bylehpora Prison, Inmate 1</h3>
<img src="bylepprisuwa.png" alt="suwa">
<p>This is my final project for Art 74. For my final project, I decided to make a website, on which is a text game.  In this text game, you are a guard at the Bylehpora Prison conversing with one of the inmates, who is pictured in front of you.  You converse with this character by selecting from the options given after the inmate talks.  As you talk, you learn more about your character, the inmate, and the world you two are living in.  I wanted to do this because I like text games (despite being terrible at playing most of them) and wanted to try making my own.  I also wanted to write the game in this way because I wanted to practice teaching the reader or player about a fictional world purely through dialogue and/or character action.  The Javascript that went into making the game came from a template from Web Dev Simplified.  I plan to build on this in the future if possible.
